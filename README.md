# Motel-Management-System

The Motel Management system will provide service to on-line customers, employee, and an administrator. Online customers can make searches, reservations and cancel an existing reservation on the motel reservationâ€™s web site. Administrator can add/update the motel and the room information approve/disapprove a new employee account application and generate a monthly occupancy rate report for motel. This application is very easy to understand and user-friendly.
